// Item is the central concept of a piece of content
// from a service or data source. Take note of which
// methods are required to return non-empty values.
//
// The actual content of an item is stored either in
// the database or on disk as a file. Generally,
// content that is text-encoded can and should be
// stored in the database where it will be indexed.
// However, if the item's content (for example, the
// bytes of a photo or video) are not text or if the
// text is too large to store well in a database (for
// example, an entire novel), it should be stored
// on disk, and this interface has methods to
// accommodate both. Note that an item may have both
// text and non-text content, too: for example, photos
// and videos may have descriptions that are as much
// "content" as the media iteself. One part of an item
// is not mutually exclusive with any other.
type Item interface {

	// substance of the item (for example, an ID derived
	// from timestamp or from the actual content of the
	// item -- whatever makes it unique). The ID need
	// only be unique for the account it is associated

	// provides a name but no ID, you may return
	// the name as the ID with the understanding
	// that a different name will be counted as a

	// data file can be obtained, stored, and
	// later read successfully.
	//
	// DataFileName returns the filename (NOT full
	// path or URL) of the file; prefer the original
	// filename if it originated as a file. If the
	// filename is not unique on disk when downloaded,
	// it will be made unique by modifying it. If
	// this value is nil/empty, a filename will be
	// generated from the item's other data.
	//
	// DataFileReader returns a way to read the data.
	// It will be closed when the read is completed.
	//
	// DataFileHash returns the checksum of the
	// content as provided by the service. If the
	// service (or data source) does not provide a
	// hash, leave this field empty, but note that
	// later it will be impossible to efficiently
	// know whether the content has changed on the
